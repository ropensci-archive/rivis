R Interactive Visualisation Working Group (A placeholder title)

10 years ago `ggplot2` revolutionised the accesibility of R for making beautiful scientific graphics. Just 5 years ago there was boom in R interfaces for web-capable interactive graphics libraries and it looked as though a new breed of scientific graphics was close. Unfortunately the promise of many of those efforts has since faded. A clear shared-vision for how R will implement the capabilities demanded by the next generation of grapics has not emerged. This is true for very practical applications like streaming data, and interactive visualisations. It is equally true for further out questions about how R can respond to trends like [reactive graphics](https://medium.com/@mbostock/a-better-way-to-code-2b1d2876a3a0), WebGl, and virtual reality.    

This newly formed group is in the process of determining the next iteration of graphics for R. This repo is a place to conduct an inclusive public conversation about what that should look like and how to deliver it.
